# Proyecto Viviana Monorepo

## Stack
- [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) — High-performance build system for Monorepos. Based on "Design System" template.
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) — Build tool for webapps
- [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/start/overview) — Full-stack framework based on React and built on top of [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/overview)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) — JavaScript library for user interfaces
- [Tsup](https://github.com/egoist/tsup) — TypeScript bundler powered by esbuild
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) — UI component environment powered by Vite
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for managing versioning and changelogs
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/changesets/action) for fully automated package publishing

### Commands

- `pnpm build` - Build all packages
- `pnpm dev` - Run all packages locally and preview with Storybook
- `pnpm lint` - Lint all packages
- `pnpm changeset` - Generate a changeset
- `pnpm clean` - Clean up all `node_modules` and `dist` folders (runs each package's clean script)

### Compilation

Running `pnpm build` from the root of the Turborepo will run the `build` command defined in each package's `package.json` file. Turborepo runs each `build` in parallel and caches & hashes the output to speed up future builds.

For `acme-core`, the `build` command is the following:

```bash
tsup src/index.tsx --format esm,cjs --dts --external react
```

`tsup` compiles `src/index.tsx`, which exports all of the components in the design system, into both ES Modules and CommonJS formats as well as their TypeScript types. The `package.json` for `acme-core` then instructs the consumer to select the correct format:

```json:acme-core/package.json
{
  "name": "@acme/core",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "main": "./dist/index.js",
  "module": "./dist/index.mjs",
  "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
  "sideEffects": false,
}
```

Run `pnpm build` to confirm compilation is working correctly. You should see a folder `acme-core/dist` which contains the compiled output.

```bash
acme-core
└── dist
    ├── index.d.ts  <-- Types
    ├── index.js    <-- CommonJS version
    └── index.mjs   <-- ES Modules version
```

## Versioning & Publishing Packages

This example uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versions, create changelogs, and publish to npm. It's preconfigured so you can start publishing packages immediately.

You'll need to create an `NPM_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` and add it to your GitHub repository settings to enable access to npm. It's also worth installing the [Changesets bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) on your repository.

### Generating the Changelog

To generate your changelog, run `pnpm changeset` locally:

1. **Which packages would you like to include?** – This shows which packages and changed and which have remained the same. By default, no packages are included. Press `space` to select the packages you want to include in the `changeset`.
1. **Which packages should have a major bump?** – Press `space` to select the packages you want to bump versions for.
1. If doing the first major version, confirm you want to release.
1. Write a summary for the changes.
1. Confirm the changeset looks as expected.
1. A new Markdown file will be created in the `changeset` folder with the summary and a list of the packages included.

### Releasing

When you push your code to GitHub, the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/changesets/action) will run the `release` script defined in the root `package.json`:

```bash
turbo run build --filter=docs^... && changeset publish
```

Turborepo runs the `build` script for all publishable packages (excluding docs) and publishes the packages to npm. By default, this example includes `acme` as the npm organization. To change this, do the following:

- Rename folders in `packages/*` to replace `acme` with your desired scope
- Search and replace `acme` with your desired scope
- Re-run `pnpm install`
